** Efficient UUID generation (don't use system rng)

** Async size-capped buffer for incoming items
   Don't block log requests for server connection, add to buffer and
   move on. If buffer fills up, drop further logs until there's space.

** Connection pooling (bloodhound)

** Stop using Strings everywhere (bloodhound)
